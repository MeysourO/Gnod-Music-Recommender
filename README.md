# Gnod Music Recommender

## Introduction

You have been hired as a Data Analyst for Gnod. Gnod is a site that provides recommendations for music, art, literature and products based on collaborative filtering algorithms. Their flagship product is the music recommender, which you can try at www.gnoosic.com. The site asks users to input 3 bands they like, and computes similarity scores with the rest of the users. Then, they recommend to the user bands that users with similar tastes have picked.

Gnod is a small company, and its only revenue stream so far are ads in the site. In the future, they would like to explore partnership options with music apps (such as Deezer, Soundcloud, or even Apple Music and Spotify). But for that to be possible, they need to expand and improve their recommendations.

Thatâ€™s precisely where you come in. They have hired you as a Data Analyst and expect you to bring a mix of technical expertise and a business mindset to the table. Your first task is to explore new data sources for songs and create clusters of similar songs.

## The Challenge

Jane, the CTO of Gnod, has assigned you the following tasks:

1. Collect as much information as possible from popular songs using APIs or web scraping.
2. Create clusters of songs that are similar to each other. The idea is that if a user inputs a song from one group, we'll prioritize giving them recommendations of songs from that same group.

In addition to these tasks, Gnod encourages you to be open-minded about the process and provide your own vision of the product and the next steps to be taken.

## Project Goals

1. Explore new data sources for songs.
2. Collect data from popular songs (a few hundred or thousand from each source).
3. Create clusters of similar songs to enhance the music recommendation system.

## Presentation

On Friday, you will present your work to Jane (CTO) and Marek (CEO and founder). Be convincing about the song recommender, as this has been Jane's personal push and the main reason you were hired!

Good luck and enjoy the ride!
